Introduction 

SEcollab is a web application that connects software engineers (SEs) with each other to collaborate on projects. The platform allows SEs to create profiles, post their skills and interests, and connect with other SEs who have complementary skills. The goal of SEcollab is to facilitate the formation of successful software engineering teams and encourage collaboration among professionals in the field. 

  

  The website is deployed at https://www.secollab.com. You can read a blog post about the project at https://www.secollab.com/blog/introducing-secollab. The project was developed by Zelalem Getnet and FFikadu Getnet.
